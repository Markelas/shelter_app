            <p class="about_text_justify">Currently we have 121 dogs and
              342 cats on our hands and statistics show that only 20% of them will find a family. The
              others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a lucky chance to become dearly loved.

              We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they
              do not get sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and
              well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28 employees of
              various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, they become
              attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
